This file contains information for each run in the uniformshelf directory. Inputs for individual runs can be found in inputs, these are linked to the run directories found in run, model output for each run is found in output. input/run/output directory numbers are consistent across components. 

Run 1: Initial testing run for simulation file size, wall clock time, and for wyatt to familiarize himself with running simulations on galapagos. Uses 64 cores split 4 in x and 16 in y. Monitor frequency is daily, model state and diagnostics are output is every 10 days, and total runtime is 365 days.

Run 2: Extended initial testing run for simulations. 24 cores split 4 in x and 6 in y. Monitor frequency is daily. Model state and diagnostics are output every 30 days. Total run time is 10 years.
